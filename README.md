# hyperspace

### Intention

This project is trying to create an environment where the user can "experiment" 4th dimension through a set of basic commands.

### Environment

For now the focus is on a FPS like interaction. Developed in Unity, I deploy the project with the latest community version.

### Assets

I use Engine4D plugins to implement the 4D engine.

### Controls

* Character is mover with first person basic controls assigned to the main camera.  
* 'Q' to change dimension visibility
* 'TAB' to fix camera  
* Click and drag to move the object
